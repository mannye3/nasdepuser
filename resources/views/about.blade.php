                    <p  class="mb25">NASDeP collates standardized information on growth-oriented enterprises and presents such information to prescreened investors. Such investors may range from casual, financial and strategic investors, to institutional firms who will provide operational enterprises with crucial access to capital and guidance from the best managers in the industry</p>
                    <p  class="mb25">Enterprises in different markets, business environments with growth opportunities require long-term capital to finance their operations. Weak support from the formal capital market forces such companies to borrow from commercial banks at expensive rates. NASDeP bridges this gap by showcasing qualified enterprises to venture capital, private equity and other accredited investors who are seeking investment opportunities.</p>
